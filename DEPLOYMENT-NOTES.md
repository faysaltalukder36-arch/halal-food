# Halal Food — Delivery Notes

## Google Apps Script redeployment required

This repository now sends two additional order fields:

- `district`
- `upazila`

The updated `google-apps-script.gs` file includes matching **District** and **Upazila** columns.

**Important:** changing `google-apps-script.gs` in this GitHub repository does **not** automatically update the live Google Apps Script Web App.

After uploading this site update, manually:

1. Open the Google Apps Script project connected to the `Orders` sheet.
2. Replace the deployed script code with the updated `google-apps-script.gs` code.
3. Choose **Deploy → Manage deployments**.
4. Edit the existing Web App deployment.
5. Create/select a new version and deploy it.
6. Keep the same Web App URL so the existing `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL` in `js/main.js` remains unchanged.

Historical rows already stored in the Google Sheet are not modified by this update.

## Hero images

The redesign introduces these new image paths. They are placeholders and can be replaced later without changing filenames:

- `images/hero/founder-banner.jpg`
- `images/hero/organic-banner.jpg`
- `images/hero/oil-banner.jpg`
- `images/hero/honey-banner-desktop.jpg`

The founder banner currently contains an explicit TODO because the founder's personal website URL was not supplied.

## Existing resources

Existing image filenames and paths were preserved. The existing Google Apps Script URL, WhatsApp number, telephone link, canonical site URL, price-list PDF, robots.txt, and sitemap base URL were not changed except for adding the new category/product URLs required by the specification.
